                    <h2 className=" text-black text-2xl text-start"><u><b>Ans:</b></u> SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.</h2>

                    <h2 className=" text-black text-2xl text-start"><u><b>Ans:</b></u> JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server.<br /> <br />JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</h2>

                    <h2 className=" text-black text-2xl text-start"><u><b>Ans:</b></u> JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed.<br /> <br /> Node. js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the JavaScript programming language.</h2>

                    <h2 className=" text-black text-2xl text-start"><u><b>Ans:</b></u> NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.</h2>
